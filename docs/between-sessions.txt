  One uncommitted change from this session:
  - shared/config.py - Changed STORAGE_MODE default from "local" to "azure" and added warning log

Issues to Address:
 1. ✅ FIXED: Storage mode default changed from "local" to "azure" in config.py
 2. Add date format validation to metrics endpoints (HIGH - prevents injection)
 3. Enable prompt injection blocking vs logging-only (HIGH for public demo)
 4. Add rate limiting to GET endpoints (MEDIUM)

 Known Issue Reference: Commit 7869d00 fixed Azure Blob Storage async compatibility
